# The Q
This is a small PWA that can hold a list of questions for people that like to hold quizzes. I used it as a "repository" for my "Q's" or questions.

This PWA is also a working experiment in building a solid PWA, in React, with Firebase. You learn the best by doing!

The `create-react-app` documentation is found in the [cra-README.md](cra-README.md) file.
